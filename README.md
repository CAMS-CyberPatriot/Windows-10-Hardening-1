# Windows-10-Hardening

**Important note: I have effectively abandoned this project. Anyone who wishes to contribute further is welcome.**

A collective resource of settings modifications (*mostly opt-outs*) that attempt to make Windows 10 as private and as secure as possible.

### Registry

* [Windows 10 batch file](../master/registry/windows10.bat)

* [Office 2016 batch file](../master/registry/office2016.bat)

### Group policy

* [List of Windows 10 Group policy changes](../master/group_policy/windows10.MD)

### Issues

1. Group policy registry references often change after major updates. This requires updates to these scripts.

2. Many of these modifications are mere *opt-outs*, and are not means to ensure Microsoft are unable to collect telemetry data.
